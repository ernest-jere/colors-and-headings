    <p>Software engineer vs software developer: the differences between the two
    fields can often take time to identify. The two careers are interdependent
    and their responsibilities often overlap. However, simply put, software 
    developers execute various programming experiments using the constructed 
    architecture pre-established by software engineers.</p>
    <p>Thereby, the software engineer comes first in the chain. They create the
    systems on which the software developers later carry out the procedures, 
    using their technical and programming skills.</p>
    <div class="red-bar"><h2>Software Engineer</h2></div>
    <p>A software engineer uses elaborate engineering principles to create 
    applications, programs and entire computer systems. These can range from a 
    network platform designed to handle all company affairs to something seemingly 
    as basic as a computer or mobile game.</p>
    <div class="grey"><h3>What are the skills required to be a software engineer?</h3></div>
    <p>The skills required to be a software engineer include writing, testing, and 
    evaluating code and interpersonal skills. The ideal job applicant will also have 
    an in-depth understanding of consumer needs and a general proficiency in 
    object-oriented design.</p>
    <div class="blue-bar"><h2>Software Developer</h2></div>
    <p>Being a software developer involves precisely what the title would suggest: 
    developing software that is able to be used on different systems and platforms. 
    This role comes into play in a softwareâ€™s lifecycle when it is time to create 
    the structure, which will contribute to creating a fully functioning and 
    user-appropriate product.</p>
    <div class="grey"><h3>What skills are required to be a software developer?</h3></div>
    <p>The skills required to be a software developer include proficiency in multiple 
    fields, such as programming languages and developer tools. An aspiring developer 
    should also have extensive knowledge of mathematics, ongoing computer trends, and 
    excellent problem-solving skills.</p>
    <div class="grey"><h4>Which career path is better for you?</h4></div>
    <p>Software development might suit task-oriented aspirants interested in 
    troubleshooting and product development. On the other hand, an engineering role 
    might be ideal for you if you are highly creative and have a conceptual thinking 
    style.</p>
